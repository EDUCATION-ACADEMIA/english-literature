<title>IRONY:Choose the letter for the type of irony best illustrated in the passage:Cassie was unhappy in her relationship with Richard. There wasnt anything that was wrong ﻿with him. He did cut her off occasionally while she was trying to speak, but overall he was a good guy. She just wanted something different. She decided that she would break up with Richard tonight. As soon as Richard arrived at her house, she wanted to sit him down and talk to him about it, but he rushed her out the door. No time to talk now, Babe, he said. Were late for our dinner reservations. So she figured that she would tell him at the restaurant, near the end of the meal. She would even offer to pay. So they ate a delicious meal and right before dessert, Cassie opened her mouth to let out the words that would be fatal to their relationship, Richard ..... she began, but Richard broke in, Oh, Babe, I have a surprise for you. He pulled a small white envelope from his pocket and pulled two tickets from it. Two front row tickets to see your favorite band, The Mountain boys! Cassies mouth dropped. Richard backpedaled, Im sorry that I cut you off again. What was it that you wanted to tell me? Cassie looked down at the piece of cake in front of her and replied, Oh, I forget. Nothing important.
